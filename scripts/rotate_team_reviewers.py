Team Reviewer Rotation

This script assigns reviewers to teams based on team composition.

TEAMS ROTATION (this file - rotate_team_reviewers.py):
- Assigns reviewers to teams based on team composition
- Each team can specify "Number of Reviewers" in the sheet
- Uses DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER as fallback if column is empty
- Just like individual developers, each team can have a different number
  of reviewers
- Uses SECOND sheet (index 1)

Assignment Logic (for team needing N reviewers):
1. If team has 0 members:
   ‚Üí Assign N experienced developers (load-balanced)

2. If team has fewer members than N:
   ‚Üí Use all team members as reviewers
   ‚Üí Fill remaining slots with experienced devs (not from team,
     load-balanced)

3. If team has >= N members:
   ‚Üí Select N members from the team (load-balanced)

Load Balancing:
- Tracks how many teams each developer is reviewing
- Prioritizes developers with fewer assignments for fairness
- Prevents scenarios where one dev reviews 5 teams while others review 0

Examples:
- Team needs 2 reviewers, has 0 members ‚Üí 2 experienced devs
  (least assigned)
- Team needs 2 reviewers, has 1 member ‚Üí the team member +
  1 experienced dev (least assigned)
- Team needs 2 reviewers, has 3+ members ‚Üí 2 random members from team
  (least assigned)
- Team needs 3 reviewers, has 5 members ‚Üí 3 members from team
  (least assigned)

SCHEDULE:
- Called automatically by "Run All Review Rotations" workflow every Wednesday
  at 5:00 AM Finland Time (3:00 AM UTC)
- Only executes if 15 days have passed since last rotation
- Can also be triggered manually via "Run Teams Review Rotation" workflow

NOTE: Uses the SECOND sheet/tab in the Google Sheet (index 1)
