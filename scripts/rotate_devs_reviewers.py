"""
Individual Developer Reviewer Rotation

This script assigns reviewers to individual developers
(rotate_devs_reviewers.py).

BUSINESS LOGIC:
1. Each developer can specify their own "Number of Reviewers" in the
   Google Sheet
   - Uses DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER as fallback if column is empty
   - Allows per-developer customization (e.g., Dev3 needs 2, Dev2 needs 3)

2. Experience-Based Assignment Rules:
   a) NON-EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS:
      - Can ONLY be assigned experienced developers as reviewers
      - Cannot have non-experienced developers reviewing their code

   b) EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS:
      - Must have at least 1 experienced developer as reviewer (mandatory)
      - Can have at most 1 non-experienced developer as additional reviewer
      - Example: Valid assignments: [Exp1, Exp2], [Exp1, NonExp1]
      - Example: Invalid assignment: [NonExp1, NonExp2]

3. Reviewer Selection Priority (in order):
   a) PREFERABLE REVIEWERS: Tries to assign reviewers from the
      developer's "Preferable Reviewers" list first
      - For non-experienced devs: only experienced devs from preferable list
   b) EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS: Ensures EVERY developer gets at least 1
      experienced developer as a reviewer (mandatory requirement)
   c) EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS: Fills remaining slots with experienced devs
   d) NON-EXPERIENCED DEVELOPERS: For experienced devs only, can add up to
      1 non-experienced dev if slots remain

4. Load Balancing & Smart Selection:
   - Never assigns a developer to review themselves
   - Tracks how many developers each reviewer is assigned to
   - Prioritizes reviewers with fewer assignments for fairness
   - Prevents scenarios where one reviewer gets 5 assignments while
     others get 0
   - Randomizes selection among equally loaded reviewers

5. Customization via Google Sheet:
   - "Number of Reviewers" column: How many reviewers this developer needs
   - "Preferable Reviewers" column: Comma-separated list of preferred names
   - Config sheet: Lists experienced developers

EXAMPLE 1 (Non-Experienced Developer):
Developer: Dev1 (non-experienced)
Number of Reviewers: 2
Preferable Reviewers: Dev2, Dev11
Experienced Devs: Dev2, Dev3, Dev4, Dev5

Allocation Process:
1. Try preferable: Dev2 (‚úì experienced) ‚Üí assigned
   (Dev11 skipped - not experienced)
2. Fill remaining: Dev3 (‚úì experienced) ‚Üí assigned
Result: Dev1 ‚Üí reviewed by Dev2, Dev3

EXAMPLE 2 (Experienced Developer):
Developer: Dev2 (experienced)
Number of Reviewers: 2
Preferable Reviewers: Dev3, Dev1
Experienced Devs: Dev2, Dev3, Dev4, Dev5

Allocation Process:
1. Try preferable: Dev3 (‚úì available) ‚Üí assigned
2. Check experienced: Dev3 already assigned ‚Üí requirement met ‚úì
3. Fill remaining: Can add 1 non-experienced (e.g., Dev1) ‚Üí assigned
Result: Dev2 ‚Üí reviewed by Dev3, Dev1

SCHEDULE:
- Called automatically by "Run All Review Rotations" workflow every Wednesday
  at 5:00 AM Finland Time (3:00 AM UTC)
- Only executes if 15 days have passed since last rotation
- Can also be triggered manually via "Run Developers Review Rotation" workflow
- Manual runs update existing column, scheduled runs create new column

NOTE: Uses the FIRST sheet/tab in the Google Sheet (index 0)
