# Complete Migration Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers **ALL changes** from the original version to the current version, including:
- Column renames (for clarity)
- Column deletions (removed unused/obsolete columns)
- New Config sheet (centralized configuration)
- Sheet reordering (Config becomes first sheet)
- GitHub Secrets cleanup (moved configuration to Google Sheets)

### Philosophy Behind Changes

**üéØ Main Goal:** Move configuration from GitHub Secrets ‚Üí Google Sheets

**Why?**
1. **Accessibility:** Non-technical team members can update configuration
2. **Simplicity:** No need to navigate GitHub repository settings
3. **Single Source of Truth:** All data in one place (Google Sheets)
4. **Better UX:** Edit configuration alongside the data it affects
5. **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer GitHub Secrets to manage

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Rename Columns in Individual Developers Sheet

1. Go to your **FE Devs** (or Individual Developers) sheet
2. Update the header row:
   - Cell B1: Change `Reviewer Number` ‚Üí `Number of Reviewers`
   - Cell C1: Change `Indexes` ‚Üí `Preferable Reviewers`

### Step 2: Update Columns in Teams Sheet

1. Go to your **Teams** sheet
2. Update the header row:
   - Cell B1: Change `Default Developer` ‚Üí `Team Developers`
   - Cell C1: Change `Reviewer Number` ‚Üí `Number of Reviewers`
3. **Delete Column D** (`Indexes` column - no longer needed)

### Step 3: Create Config Sheet

1. **Insert a new sheet** at the beginning
2. Name it "Config" (or any name you prefer)
3. **Option A: Empty Config (uses defaults)**
   - Just create an empty sheet - that's it!
   - System will use: `reviewer_number=1`, `experienced_devs=empty`
   
4. **Option B: Populate Config (recommended)**
   - Set up the structure:

```
     A                        |  B
1    Experienced Developers   |  Default Number of Reviewers
2    Dev2                     |  2
3    Dev3                     |
4    Dev4                     |
5    Dev5                     |
6    Dev6                     |
7    Dev7                     |
8    Dev8                     |
9    Dev9                     |
10   Dev10                    |
11   Dev11                    |
```

**Important:**
- Column A: List ALL experienced developers (one per row, starting from A2)
- Cell B2: Enter the default number of reviewers (e.g., `2`)
- Names must match **exactly** with names in your other sheets

### Step 4: Reorder Sheets

Drag the sheet tabs at the bottom to ensure this order:
1. **Config** (must be first)
2. **Individual Developers / FE Devs** (must be second)
3. **Teams** (must be third)

### Step 5: Clean Up GitHub Secrets

Go to GitHub ‚Üí Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions

**Delete these secrets (no longer needed):**

- ‚ùå **`DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER`**
  - **Why removed:** This configuration is now stored in the Config sheet (Cell B2)
  - **Benefit:** Non-technical team members can update it without GitHub access
  - **Where it is now:** Config sheet, Cell B2

- ‚ùå **`EXPERIENCED_DEV_NAMES`**
  - **Why removed:** This list is now stored in the Config sheet (Column A, from A2 onwards)
  - **Benefit:** Easy to add/remove experienced developers without touching GitHub
  - **Where it is now:** Config sheet, Column A (starting from A2)

- ‚ùå **`REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST`**
  - **Why removed:** The rotation logic was completely refactored and no longer uses index-based configuration
  - **Old system:** Used the "Indexes" column to manually specify which reviewers to assign
  - **New system:** Automatically assigns reviewers based on team composition (member count)
  - **Status:** Completely obsolete with the new logic
  - üìñ **[See FAQ: Why was REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST removed?](#why-was-reviewers_config_list-removed-what-was-the-logic-refactoring)** for detailed explanation

**Keep these secrets:**
- ‚úÖ `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON` - Required for authentication with Google Sheets API
- ‚úÖ `SHEET_NAME` - Required to identify which Google Sheet to use

---

### üìä GitHub Secrets: Before vs After

**BEFORE (Old System):**
```
1. GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
2. SHEET_NAME
3. DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER       ‚ùå ‚Üí Moved to Config sheet
4. EXPERIENCED_DEV_NAMES          ‚ùå ‚Üí Moved to Config sheet
5. REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST          ‚ùå ‚Üí Obsolete (logic refactored)
```

**AFTER (New System):**
```
1. GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON        ‚úÖ Still needed
2. SHEET_NAME                     ‚úÖ Still needed
```

**Result:** 5 secrets ‚Üí 2 secrets üéâ

### Step 6: Test the Setup

**Option A: Test Locally**
```bash
export SHEET_NAME="your-sheet-name"
export CREDENTIAL_FILE="credentials.json"

# Test Individual Developers rotation
poetry run python scripts/rotate_devs_reviewers.py

# Test Teams rotation
poetry run python scripts/rotate_team_reviewers.py
```

**Option B: Test via GitHub Actions**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Individual Developers Review Rotation"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Verify success and check the Google Sheet

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Unknown headers" error

**Error:** `GSpreadException: the given 'expected_headers' contains unknown headers`

**Solution:** Make sure you've renamed ALL columns exactly as shown above:
- Individual Developers: `Number of Reviewers`, `Preferable Reviewers`
- Teams: `Team Developers`, `Number of Reviewers`

### "Config sheet is empty or missing data"

**Solution:** 
- Ensure Config sheet is the **first sheet** (index 0)
- Cell B2 must contain a number (e.g., `2`)
- Column A must have developer names starting from A2

### Wrong sheet order error

**Solution:** Drag tabs at the bottom to ensure:
1. Config (first)
2. Individual Developers (second)
3. Teams (third)

### Names don't match

**Solution:** Developer names in Config sheet Column A must match **exactly** with:
- Names in Individual Developers sheet (Column A)
- Names in Teams sheet "Team Developers" column
- Check for typos, extra spaces, or wrong capitalization

## ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Why was `REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` removed? What was the "logic refactoring"?

**The Old System (Index-Based):**

The old Teams rotation used a manual, index-based configuration system:

1. **`REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` Secret:** Contained a list like `"0,1;2,3;4,5"` where numbers corresponded to developer indexes
2. **`Indexes` Column:** Each team had an "Indexes" column (e.g., `"0, 1"`) pointing to specific reviewers
3. **Manual Assignment:** You had to manually configure which reviewer indexes to use for each team

**Example of Old System:**
```
Team: Team1
Indexes: 0, 1

Where:
- 0 = First developer in the list (e.g., Dev3)
- 1 = Second developer in the list (e.g., Dev2)

So Team1 would always get Dev3 and Dev2 as reviewers.
```

**Problems with Old System:**
- ‚ùå **Manual maintenance:** Had to update indexes every time you added/removed developers
- ‚ùå **Not intuitive:** Index numbers aren't clear (who is "0"? who is "5"?)
- ‚ùå **Prone to errors:** Wrong index = wrong reviewer
- ‚ùå **Not load-balanced:** Same reviewers could be assigned to multiple teams
- ‚ùå **Requires GitHub access:** Non-technical users couldn't update configuration

---

**The New System (Team Composition-Based):**

The new Teams rotation is **automatic and intelligent**:

1. **No manual configuration needed** - Logic is based on team composition
2. **Automatically balances load** - Distributes assignments evenly across experienced developers
3. **No indexes needed** - Uses actual developer names from Teams sheet

**How New Logic Works:**

```
For each team, check the "Team Developers" column:

‚îú‚îÄ Team has 0 members?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Assign N random experienced developers (not from any team)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Team has < N members? (where N = "Number of Reviewers")
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Use ALL team members as reviewers
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Fill remaining slots with experienced developers (excluding team members)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Team has >= N members?
   ‚îî‚îÄ Randomly select N members from the team
```

**Example of New System:**
```
Team: Team1
Team Developers: Dev5, Dev2, Dev10
Number of Reviewers: 2

Logic:
‚Üí Team has 3 members, needs 2 reviewers
‚Üí Randomly select 2 from [Dev5, Dev2, Dev10]
‚Üí Result: Dev2, Dev10 (for this rotation)
```

**Benefits of New System:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully automatic** - No manual configuration needed
- ‚úÖ **Load balanced** - Assignments distributed evenly
- ‚úÖ **Self-explanatory** - Uses real names, not cryptic indexes
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic** - Adapts to team changes automatically
- ‚úÖ **Fair rotation** - Everyone gets equal review opportunities

---

### Do I need to do anything to migrate from the old logic to the new logic?

**No code changes needed!** Just follow the migration steps:

1. Delete the `Indexes` column from Teams sheet
2. Delete the `REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` secret from GitHub
3. The new logic will automatically take over

The new system uses the existing `Team Developers` column to determine assignments.

---

### What if I want specific reviewers for a specific team?

The new system doesn't support manually pinning specific reviewers to teams. Instead, it uses:

- **Team members** (from "Team Developers" column) when the team has members
- **Experienced developers** (from Config sheet) when the team needs more reviewers

If you need custom logic, you would need to modify `scripts/rotate_team_reviewers.py`.

---

### Can I still use the "Number of Reviewers" column per team?

**Yes!** ‚úÖ Each team can specify its own "Number of Reviewers" in Column C. If empty, it uses the default from the Config sheet (Cell B2).

**Example:**
```
| Team       | Team Developers | Number of Reviewers | ...
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|----
| Team1      | Dev5, Dev2      | 3                   | ... (3 reviewers)
| Team2      | Dev3            |                     | ... (uses default: 2)
| Team3      | Dev1            | 1                   | ... (1 reviewer)
```

---

### Are all three sheets required?

**Two sheets must exist, one is optional:**

- **Config Sheet (index 0)** - ‚úÖ **Must exist, but content is optional**
  - **The sheet itself MUST exist** (to keep indices consistent)
  - **Content is completely optional** - can be blank/empty
  - If empty or columns missing: Uses defaults (reviewer_number=1, experienced_devs=empty)
  - If populated: Loads your custom configuration
  - **Why required?** So Individual Developers is always at index 1, Teams at index 2

- **Individual Developers (index 1)** - ‚úÖ **Required with content**
  - This is the main sheet for developer rotations
  - Must have proper structure and content
  - Without this, the rotation won't work

- **Teams Sheet (index 2)** - üîµ **Optional (can be omitted entirely)**
  - If missing: Teams rotation is skipped silently
  - If present: Teams rotation runs normally
  - **Perfect for gradual adoption!**

**Minimum Setup:**
1. **Create Config sheet** (first tab) - Can be completely empty
2. **Create Individual Developers sheet** (second tab) - Must have content
3. *(Optional)* **Create Teams sheet** (third tab) - Only if you need it

**Example of minimal Config sheet:**
```
Just create an empty sheet tab named "Config" - that's it!
No headers, no data needed. System will use defaults.
```

The system gracefully handles empty Config sheets and missing Teams sheets.
