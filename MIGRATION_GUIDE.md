# Complete Migration Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers **ALL changes** from the original version to the current version, including:
- Column renames (for clarity)
- Column deletions (removed unused/obsolete columns)
- New Config sheet (centralized configuration)
- Sheet reordering (Config becomes first sheet)
- GitHub Secrets cleanup (moved configuration to Google Sheets)

### Philosophy Behind Changes

**üéØ Main Goal:** Move configuration from GitHub Secrets ‚Üí Google Sheets

**Why?**
1. **Accessibility:** Non-technical team members can update configuration
2. **Simplicity:** No need to navigate GitHub repository settings
3. **Single Source of Truth:** All data in one place (Google Sheets)
4. **Better UX:** Edit configuration alongside the data it affects
5. **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer GitHub Secrets to manage

## üÜï What's Changing: From 5 Secrets ‚Üí 1 Secret + 1 Variable

### **The Big Change**

**Before (Old System):**
- 5 GitHub Secrets to manage
- Configuration hidden in GitHub settings
- Hard to update, requires GitHub access

**After (New System):**
- 1 GitHub Secret (credentials only)
- 1 GitHub Variable (sheet name - visible and editable)
- Configuration in Google Sheets (easy for everyone to update)

### **Migration Overview**

You'll be moving from:

```
‚ùå 5 Secrets:
   1. GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
   2. SHEET_NAME
   3. DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER
   4. EXPERIENCED_DEV_NAMES
   5. REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST

‚úÖ 1 Secret + 1 Variable:
   Secret:   GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON
   Variable: SHEET_NAMES (supports single or multiple sheets)
   
   ‚Üí Everything else moves to Config sheet in Google Sheets!
```

### **Why This Change?**

1. **Fewer Secrets to Manage:** 5 ‚Üí 1 secret
2. **Better Organization:** Sensitive data (credentials) separate from config (sheet names)
3. **Easier Updates:** Edit Config sheet instead of GitHub Secrets
4. **Team-Friendly:** Non-technical users can update configuration
5. **Visible Config:** See sheet names without re-entering them

### **üÜï Bonus: Multi-Sheet Support**

As part of this update, you can now manage multiple teams (Frontend, Backend, Mobile) with separate Google Sheets - all processed automatically!

## üìã Complete List of Changes

### **Individual Developers Sheet (FE Devs)**

**Column Changes:**

| Old Column Name | New Column Name | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `Reviewer Number` | `Number of Reviewers` | ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed |
| `Indexes` | `Preferable Reviewers` | ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed |

**Current Structure:**
```
A: Developer
B: Number of Reviewers
C: Preferable Reviewers
D+: Date columns (e.g., 23-10-2025)
```

### **Teams Sheet**

**Column Changes:**

| Old Column Name | New Column Name | Status |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| `Default Developer` | `Team Developers` | ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed |
| `Reviewer Number` | `Number of Reviewers` | ‚úèÔ∏è Renamed |
| `Indexes` | *(removed)* | ‚ùå Deleted ([Why?](#why-was-reviewers_config_list-removed-what-was-the-logic-refactoring)) |

**Current Structure:**
```
A: Team
B: Team Developers
C: Number of Reviewers
D+: Date columns (e.g., 23-10-2025)
```

### **New Config Sheet**

**Status:** üÜï NEW - Must be created

**Structure:**
```
A: Unexperienced Developers (list from A2 onwards - INVERTED LOGIC)
B: Default Number of Reviewers (value in B2)
```

**Note:** INVERTED LOGIC - List only junior/unexperienced developers in Column A.
Everyone NOT on this list is considered experienced.
Empty list = all developers are experienced (safe default).

### **Sheet Order Change**

**Before:**
1. Individual Developers (index 0)
2. Teams (index 1)

**After:**
1. Config (index 0) - NEW
2. Individual Developers (index 1)
3. Teams (index 2)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Migration

### Step 1: Rename Columns in Individual Developers Sheet

1. Go to your **FE Devs** (or Individual Developers) sheet
2. Update the header row:
   - Cell B1: Change `Reviewer Number` ‚Üí `Number of Reviewers`
   - Cell C1: Change `Indexes` ‚Üí `Preferable Reviewers`

### Step 2: Update Columns in Teams Sheet

1. Go to your **Teams** sheet
2. Update the header row:
   - Cell B1: Change `Default Developer` ‚Üí `Team Developers`
   - Cell C1: Change `Reviewer Number` ‚Üí `Number of Reviewers`
3. **Delete Column D** (`Indexes` column - no longer needed)

### Step 3: Create Config Sheet

1. **Insert a new sheet** at the beginning
2. Name it "Config" (or any name you prefer)
3. **Option A: Empty Config (uses defaults)**
   - Just create an empty sheet - that's it!
   - System will use: `reviewer_number=1`, `experienced_devs=empty`
   
4. **Option B: Populate Config (recommended)**
   - Set up the structure:

```
     A                          |  B
1    Unexperienced Developers   |  Default Number of Reviewers
2    Dev1                       |  2
3    Dev11                      |
4    Dev12                      |
```

**Important (INVERTED LOGIC):**
- Column A: List ALL **unexperienced/junior** developers (one per row, starting from A2)
- **Everyone NOT on this list is considered experienced**
- Empty list = all developers are experienced (safe default!)
- Cell B2: Enter the default number of reviewers (e.g., `2`)
- Names must match **exactly** with names in your other sheets

### Step 4: Reorder Sheets

Drag the sheet tabs at the bottom to ensure this order:
1. **Config** (must be first)
2. **Individual Developers / FE Devs** (must be second)
3. **Teams** (must be third)

### Step 5: Update GitHub Configuration (5 Secrets ‚Üí 1 Secret + 1 Variable)

Go to GitHub ‚Üí Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions

**A) Create Variable (New!):**

1. Click **"Variables" tab**
2. Click **"New repository variable"**
3. Create this variable:

   **Variable Name:** `SHEET_NAMES`
   
   **For single sheet:**
   ```
   Front End - Code Reviewers
   ```
   
   **For multiple sheets:**
   ```
   Front End - Code Reviewers
   Backend - Code Reviewers
   Mobile - Code Reviewers
   ```

**B) Delete Old Secrets:**

Click **"Secrets" tab** and delete these 4 secrets:

- ‚ùå **`SHEET_NAME`** ‚Üí Now a **Variable** (more visible, easier to edit)
- ‚ùå **`DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER`** ‚Üí Now in **Config sheet** (Cell B2)
- ‚ùå **`EXPERIENCED_DEV_NAMES`** ‚Üí Now in **Config sheet** (Column A, with INVERTED logic)
- ‚ùå **`REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST`** ‚Üí Obsolete (new automatic logic)

**C) Keep This Secret:**

- ‚úÖ **`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`** - Still needed (contains sensitive credentials)

**Result: 5 Secrets ‚Üí 1 Secret + 1 Variable** üéâ

---

### üìä GitHub Configuration: Before vs After

**BEFORE (Old System):**
```
Secrets (5 total):
1. GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON       ‚úÖ Keep as Secret
2. SHEET_NAME                    ‚Üí Move to Variable
3. DEFAULT_REVIEWER_NUMBER       ‚Üí Move to Config sheet
4. EXPERIENCED_DEV_NAMES         ‚Üí Move to Config sheet (with inverted logic)
5. REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST         ‚Üí Delete (obsolete)
```

**AFTER (New System):**
```
Secrets (1 total):
1. GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON       ‚úÖ Only secret needed

Variables (1 total):
1. SHEET_NAMES                   ‚úÖ Visible & editable
   (works for single or multiple sheets)

Config Sheet (in Google Sheets):
- Default Number of Reviewers
- Unexperienced Developer Names (INVERTED: list only juniors)
```

**Result:** 5 GitHub Secrets ‚Üí 1 Secret + 1 Variable + Config Sheet üéâ

### Step 6: Test the Setup

**Option A: Test Locally**
```bash
export SHEET_NAME="your-sheet-name"
export CREDENTIAL_FILE="credentials.json"

# Test Individual Developers rotation
poetry run python scripts/rotate_devs_reviewers.py

# Test Teams rotation
poetry run python scripts/rotate_team_reviewers.py
```

**Option B: Test via GitHub Actions**
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí "Individual Developers Review Rotation"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Verify success and check the Google Sheet

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Unknown headers" error

**Error:** `GSpreadException: the given 'expected_headers' contains unknown headers`

**Solution:** Make sure you've renamed ALL columns exactly as shown above:
- Individual Developers: `Number of Reviewers`, `Preferable Reviewers`
- Teams: `Team Developers`, `Number of Reviewers`

### "Config sheet is empty or missing data"

**Solution:** 
- Ensure Config sheet is the **first sheet** (index 0)
- Cell B2 must contain a number (e.g., `2`)
- Column A must have **unexperienced/junior** developer names starting from A2
- Remember: INVERTED LOGIC - list only juniors, everyone else is experienced

### Wrong sheet order error

**Solution:** Drag tabs at the bottom to ensure:
1. Config (first)
2. Individual Developers (second)
3. Teams (third)

### Names don't match

**Solution:** Developer names in Config sheet Column A must match **exactly** with:
- Names in Individual Developers sheet (Column A)
- Names in Teams sheet "Team Developers" column
- Check for typos, extra spaces, or wrong capitalization

---

## üéâ Benefits of New Structure

- ‚ú® **No GitHub Secrets** - Configuration in Google Sheets
- üìù **Easier Updates** - Just edit the sheet
- üîç **Clearer Names** - More descriptive column headers
- üöÆ **Less Clutter** - Removed unused "Indexes" column from Teams

## ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### Why was `REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` removed? What was the "logic refactoring"?

**The Old System (Index-Based):**

The old Teams rotation used a manual, index-based configuration system:

1. **`REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` Secret:** Contained a list like `"0,1;2,3;4,5"` where numbers corresponded to developer indexes
2. **`Indexes` Column:** Each team had an "Indexes" column (e.g., `"0, 1"`) pointing to specific reviewers
3. **Manual Assignment:** You had to manually configure which reviewer indexes to use for each team

**Example of Old System:**
```
Team: Team1
Indexes: 0, 1

Where:
- 0 = First developer in the list (e.g., Dev3)
- 1 = Second developer in the list (e.g., Dev2)

So Team1 would always get Dev3 and Dev2 as reviewers.
```

**Problems with Old System:**
- ‚ùå **Manual maintenance:** Had to update indexes every time you added/removed developers
- ‚ùå **Not intuitive:** Index numbers aren't clear (who is "0"? who is "5"?)
- ‚ùå **Prone to errors:** Wrong index = wrong reviewer
- ‚ùå **Not load-balanced:** Same reviewers could be assigned to multiple teams
- ‚ùå **Requires GitHub access:** Non-technical users couldn't update configuration

---

**The New System (Team Composition-Based):**

The new Teams rotation is **automatic and intelligent**:

1. **No manual configuration needed** - Logic is based on team composition
2. **Automatically balances load** - Distributes assignments evenly across experienced developers
3. **No indexes needed** - Uses actual developer names from Teams sheet

**How New Logic Works:**

```
For each team, check the "Team Developers" column:

‚îú‚îÄ Team has 0 members?
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Assign N random experienced developers (not from any team)
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Team has < N members? (where N = "Number of Reviewers")
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Use ALL team members as reviewers
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Fill remaining slots with experienced developers (excluding team members)
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ Team has >= N members?
   ‚îî‚îÄ Randomly select N members from the team
```

**Example of New System:**
```
Team: Team1
Team Developers: Dev5, Dev2, Dev10
Number of Reviewers: 2

Logic:
‚Üí Team has 3 members, needs 2 reviewers
‚Üí Randomly select 2 from [Dev5, Dev2, Dev10]
‚Üí Result: Dev2, Dev10 (for this rotation)
```

**Benefits of New System:**
- ‚úÖ **Fully automatic** - No manual configuration needed
- ‚úÖ **Load balanced** - Assignments distributed evenly
- ‚úÖ **Self-explanatory** - Uses real names, not cryptic indexes
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic** - Adapts to team changes automatically
- ‚úÖ **Fair rotation** - Everyone gets equal review opportunities

---

### Do I need to do anything to migrate from the old logic to the new logic?

**No code changes needed!** Just follow the migration steps:

1. Delete the `Indexes` column from Teams sheet
2. Delete the `REVIEWERS_CONFIG_LIST` secret from GitHub
3. The new logic will automatically take over

The new system uses the existing `Team Developers` column to determine assignments.

---

### What if I want specific reviewers for a specific team?

The new system doesn't support manually pinning specific reviewers to teams. Instead, it uses:

- **Team members** (from "Team Developers" column) when the team has members
- **Experienced developers** (from Config sheet) when the team needs more reviewers

If you need custom logic, you would need to modify `scripts/rotate_team_reviewers.py`.

---

### Can I still use the "Number of Reviewers" column per team?

**Yes!** ‚úÖ Each team can specify its own "Number of Reviewers" in Column C. If empty, it uses the default from the Config sheet (Cell B2).

**Example:**
```
| Team       | Team Developers | Number of Reviewers | ...
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|----
| Team1      | Dev5, Dev2      | 3                   | ... (3 reviewers)
| Team2      | Dev3            |                     | ... (uses default: 2)
| Team3      | Dev1            | 1                   | ... (1 reviewer)
```

---

### Are all three sheets required?

**Two sheets must exist, one is optional:**

- **Config Sheet (index 0)** - ‚úÖ **Must exist, but content is optional**
  - **The sheet itself MUST exist** (to keep indices consistent)
  - **Content is completely optional** - can be blank/empty
  - If empty or columns missing: Uses defaults (reviewer_number=1, unexperienced_devs=empty ‚Üí all experienced)
  - If populated: Loads your custom configuration with INVERTED LOGIC (list only juniors)
  - **Why required?** So Individual Developers is always at index 1, Teams at index 2

- **Individual Developers (index 1)** - ‚úÖ **Required with content**
  - This is the main sheet for developer rotations
  - Must have proper structure and content
  - Without this, the rotation won't work

- **Teams Sheet (index 2)** - üîµ **Optional (can be omitted entirely)**
  - If missing: Teams rotation is skipped silently
  - If present: Teams rotation runs normally
  - **Perfect for gradual adoption!**

**Minimum Setup:**
1. **Create Config sheet** (first tab) - Can be completely empty
2. **Create Individual Developers sheet** (second tab) - Must have content
3. *(Optional)* **Create Teams sheet** (third tab) - Only if you need it

**Example of minimal Config sheet:**
```
Just create an empty sheet tab named "Config" - that's it!
No headers, no data needed. System will use defaults.
```

The system gracefully handles empty Config sheets and missing Teams sheets.
